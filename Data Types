Geek is learning a new programming language. As data type forms the most fundamental part of a language, Geek is learning them with focus and needs your help.
Given a data type, help Geek in finding the size of it in byte.
Data Type - Character, Integer, Long, Float and Double
Example 1:
Input: Character
Output: 1
Explaination: For java it would be 2 bytes.
Example 2:
Input: Integer
Output: 4

class Solution:
    def dataTypeSize(self, str):
        # Code here
        if str == 'Integer':
            return 4
        elif str == 'Character':
            return 1
        elif str == 'Float':
            return 4
        elif str == 'Long' or str == 'Double':
            return 8
        return -1
